/**
 * <P>The basic service for managing a set of JDBC drivers.<br>
 * <B>NOTE:</B> The {@link <code>DataSource</code>} interface, new in the
 * JDBC 2.0 API, provides another way to connect to a data source.
 * The use of a <code>DataSource</code> object is the preferred means of
 * connecting to a data source.
 *
 * <P>As part of its initialization, the <code>DriverManager</code> class will
 * attempt to load the driver classes referenced in the "jdbc.drivers"
 * system property. This allows a user to customize the JDBC Drivers
 * used by their applications. For example in your
 * ~/.hotjava/properties file you might specify:
 * <pre>
 * <CODE>jdbc.drivers=foo.bah.Driver:wombat.sql.Driver:bad.taste.ourDriver</CODE>
 * </pre>
 *<P> The <code>DriverManager</code> methods <code>getConnection</code> and
 * <code>getDrivers</code> have been enhanced to support the Java Standard Edition
 * <a href="../../../technotes/guides/jar/jar.html#Service%20Provider">Service Provider</a> mechanism. JDBC 4.0 Drivers must
 * include the file <code>META-INF/services/java.sql.Driver</code>. This file contains the name of the JDBC drivers
 * implementation of <code>java.sql.Driver</code>.  For example, to load the <code>my.sql.Driver</code> class,
 * the <code>META-INF/services/java.sql.Driver</code> file would contain the entry:
 * <pre>
 * <code>my.sql.Driver</code>
 * </pre>
 *
 * <P>Applications no longer need to explictly load JDBC drivers using <code>Class.forName()</code>. Existing programs
 * which currently load JDBC drivers using <code>Class.forName()</code> will continue to work without
 * modification.
 *
 * <P>When the method <code>getConnection</code> is called,
 * the <code>DriverManager</code> will attempt to
 * locate a suitable driver from amongst those loaded at
 * initialization and those loaded explicitly using the same classloader
 * as the current applet or application.
 *
 * <P>
 * Starting with the Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition, version 1.3, a
 * logging stream can be set only if the proper
 * permission has been granted.  Normally this will be done with
 * the tool PolicyTool, which can be used to grant <code>permission
 * java.sql.SQLPermission "setLog"</code>.
 * @see Driver
 * @see Connection

	 * that is used by the <code>DriverManager</code> and all drivers.
	 * <P>
	 * There is a minor versioning problem created by the introduction
	 * of the method <code>setLogWriter</code>.  The
	 * method <code>setLogWriter</code> cannot create a <code>PrintStream</code> object
	 * that will be returned by <code>getLogStream</code>---the Java platform does
	 * not provide a backward conversion.  As a result, a new application
	 * that uses <code>setLogWriter</code> and also uses a JDBC 1.0 driver that uses
	 * <code>getLogStream</code> will likely not see debugging information written
	 * by that driver.
	 *<P>
	 * Starting with the Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition, version 1.3 release, this method checks
	 * to see that there is an <code>SQLPermission</code> object before setting
	 * the logging stream.  If a <code>SecurityManager</code> exists and its
