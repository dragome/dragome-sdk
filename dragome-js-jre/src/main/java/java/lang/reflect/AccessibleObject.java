 * This class must be implemented by the VM vendor. This class is the superclass

 * provides the ability to toggle access checks for these objects. By default
 * accessing a member (for example, setting a field or invoking a method) checks
 * the validity of the access (for example, invoking a private method from
 * outside the defining class is prohibited) and throws IllegalAccessException
 * if the operation is not permitted. If the accessible flag is set to true,
 * these checks are omitted. This allows privileged applications such as Java
 * Object Serialization, inspectors, and debuggers to have complete access to
 * objects.
